# Unofficial MongoDB Docker Builds
ARM64 architectures less than arm64v8.2 are unsupported in official builds. The solution?

Manual labor.

These build scripts should run okay on Debian... at least once I get this working. I'll also set it up to push to Docker Hub. More info here as I actually get this to work (hopefully in the next several hours or so but we'll see...)
